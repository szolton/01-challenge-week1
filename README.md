The purpose of this project was to make the html more semantic and add accessibility features to it. I began by
- Creating a repository on GitHub
- Adding alt text
- Updating the semantic language (changing div elements to more specific terms such as main, aside, footer)
- Ensured both css and html files are properly commented & annotated
- Adding responsive design elements, making it mobile friendly
- Fixed broken links and updated the sidebar and navigation to be more responsive
